# 🚀 **Angular 101 Cheat Sheet**

> Your quick-start guide to understanding **Angular** fundamentals — clear, concise & modern.

---

## 📌 **What is Angular?**
**Angular** is a robust front-end framework for building dynamic, interactive single-page applications (SPAs) using reusable components and powerful tooling.

---

## 🧱 **What is a Component?**
A **component** is the core building block in Angular. It controls a part of the user interface and logic.

---

## 🔧 **What is a Service?**
A **service** is a reusable class that provides specific functionality (like fetching data) that can be shared across multiple components.

---

## 📦 **What is a Module?**
A **module** groups related components, directives, pipes, and services into cohesive blocks of functionality.

---

## 🎯 **What is a Directive?**
A **directive** adds custom behavior or modifies the appearance of elements in the DOM.

---

## 🔁 **What is a Pipe?**
A **pipe** transforms data in templates — for example, formatting dates, currencies, or filtering lists.

---

## 🗺️ **What is a Router?**
The **router** enables navigation between components and manages the application’s views.

---

## ✍️ **What is a Form?**
A **form** is a collection of controls that allow users to input, edit, and submit data.

---

## 🖼️ **What is a Template?**
A **template** is the HTML view that defines the layout and structure of a component’s UI.

---

## 🎨 **What is a Style Sheet?**
A **style sheet** (CSS/SCSS) defines how a component looks and feels by styling its template.

---

## 🔗 **What is Data Binding?**
**Data binding** connects component logic to the template, synchronizing data between them.

---

## ♻️ **What is Two-Way Data Binding?**
**Two-way binding** updates the view when data changes — and updates the data when the view changes.

---

## ⚡ **What is an SPA?**
A **Single Page Application (SPA)** loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without full page reloads.

---

## 🌐 **What is a RESTful API?**
A **RESTful API** provides an interface for communicating with a server by sending and receiving data over HTTP.

---

## 🗂️ **What is JSON?**
**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a lightweight data format used to exchange data between clients and servers.

---

## 📤 **What is an HTTP Request?**
An **HTTP request** is a message sent from a client to a server to retrieve or send data.

---

## 📥 **What is an HTTP Response?**
An **HTTP response** is the server’s reply to an HTTP request, delivering data or status information.

---

## ✅ **What is an HTTP Status Code?**
An **HTTP status code** is a numeric indicator of a request’s result (e.g., `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`).
